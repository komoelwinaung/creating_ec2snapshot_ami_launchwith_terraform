Testing Env: Ubuntu, Terraform, Visual Studio Code, AWS US-east region

First, we will need to make sure AWS cli, terraform configuration.

Second, data collect from required env like ec2 volume id, snapshot and edit with your suitable env.

Third, terraform init, validate, plan and apply.

That's it. Thanks!
